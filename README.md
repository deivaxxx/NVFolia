# NVFolia
A fork of Folia that supports the Bukkit API and 90% of Spigot/Paper plugins

## I am not an official developer of Folia core. I am just creating a fork of it that will help run 90% of plugins on a multithreaded core.
Please! The NVFolia is in effective development, and when using it, save a backup of the world

Most plugins have a multithreaded Folia compatibility setting, I'm building an API that runs entirely on Paper/Spigot but adds all of Folia's functionality
# The core is in Alpha Testing!
Planned supported versions 1.21.5 - 1.21.7
