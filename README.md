# NVFolia ðŸŒ´ 1.21.5 - 1.21.7 Spigot Plugins Support
A fork of Folia that supports the Bukkit API and 90% of Spigot/Paper plugins

## I am not an official developer of Folia core. I am just creating a fork of it that will help run 90% of plugins on a multithreaded core.
Please! The NVFolia is in effective development, and when using it, save a backup of the world

Most plugins have a multithreaded Folia compatibility setting, I'm building an API that runs entirely on Paper/Spigot but adds all of Folia's functionality
# The core is in Alpha Testing!
Planned supported versions 1.21.5 - 1.21.7


### ðŸ«’ I also use a simplified version of CanvasMC and the PufferFish API.
```CanvasMc``` - A redesigned system that powers Folia

```Pufferfish```-Adding DAB system and optimizing asynchronous chunk appearance

```Paper``` - The integral structure of the nucleus

```PurPur``` - For more detailed server settings

```LeafMC``` - Used to spawn mobs asynchronously and speed up single-threaded minecraft connection

```Folia``` - The main core used for NVFolia branding

## The core was specially created for the server 
play.necovanilla.ru

### What does the NVFolia multithreaded core do, each dimension has its own thread and chunk too. Now if a player is located and loads 16 chunks, then his TPS will be the same as in these 16 chunks. Other players who load their chunks will have their own TPS
