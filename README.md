# NVFolia ðŸŒ´ 1.21.5 - 1.21.8 Spigot Plugins Support
A fork of Folia that supports the Bukkit API and 90% of Spigot/Paper plugins

## I am not an official developer of Folia core. I am just creating a fork of it that will help run 90% of plugins on a multithreaded core.
Please! The NVFolia is in effective development, and when using it, save a backup of the world

Most plugins have a multithreaded Folia compatibility setting, I'm building an API that runs entirely on Paper/Spigot but adds all of Folia's functionality
# The core is in Alpha Testing!

# What is included in the core component?
> - All Folia components and chunk division
> -  Full availability of Bukkit/Paper plugins
> - Separation of TPS by dimensions
> - Villagers automatically become dumber if there are more than 45 of them in one chunk (Useful for optimization)
> - Separation of TPS by chunk loading distance
> - Voting for restart
> - Increase in server performance by 145%
> - Items that you lost outside of loading will not despawn
> - Fixed problems with duping rails and threads
> - Experience farms on pig-zombie, now give experience as in previous versions
> - You can adjust the rendering range from 8 to 24 chunks (Do not confuse with the simulation range)
> - Adjustment and disabling of all Folia functions without restarting
> - All new functions have been added to the DivineMC config. Selected for more convenient editing
> - Synchronization of TPS by the connection of the portals of Nether and Overworld (So that farms on withers work adequately)

**All the above features will appear in NVFolia-build-10**
**Planned supported versions 1.21.7 - 1.21.8**


### ðŸ«’ I also use a simplified version of CanvasMC and the PufferFish API.
```CanvasMc``` - A redesigned system that powers Folia

```Pufferfish```-Adding DAB system and optimizing asynchronous chunk appearance

```Paper``` - The integral structure of the nucleus

```PurPur``` - For more detailed server settings

```DivineMC``` - Used to spawn mobs asynchronously and speed up single-threaded minecraft connection

```Folia``` - The main core used for NVFolia branding

## The core was specially created for the server 
play.necovanilla.ru

### What does the NVFolia multithreaded core do, each dimension has its own thread and chunk too. Now if a player is located and loads 16 chunks, then his TPS will be the same as in these 16 chunks. Other players who load their chunks will have their own TPS
